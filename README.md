# Non-Ambulatory Individual Locomotion and Voice Control System

# Project Overview
This project is designed to assist non-ambulatory individuals by providing a smart locomotion system controlled through voice commands. The system enables users to move independently without physical effort, improving mobility and quality of life.

# Objectives
- Enable movement for non-ambulatory individuals
- Provide hands-free control using voice commands
- Improve independence and user comfort
- Ensure safe and simple operation

# Technologies Used
- Embedded C / Arduino
- Voice Control Module
- Motor Driver (L293D / L298N)
- DC Motors
- Microcontroller
- Power Supply Unit

# System Description
The system receives voice commands through a voice control module. These commands are processed by the microcontroller, which controls the motors using a motor driver circuit. Based on the command given, the locomotion system moves forward, backward, left, or right, allowing the user to navigate easily.
